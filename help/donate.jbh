<b>Contributions to the development of JBidwatcher are gratefully appreciated</b><br>
<br>
If you have already donated (as many have) thank you!  If JBidwatcher doesn't
provide enough value or work well enough for you, my apologies.  In either
case feel free to <a href="/Clear Donation">dismiss this message and hide
the donation button</a> with my thanks for using what is, for me, primarily
a labor of love.<br>
<br>
If JBidwatcher has been useful for you or has helped you in your eBay dealings, I'd be very grateful if you would support JBidwatcher with a donation of
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=cyberfox%40jbidwatcher.com&item_name=JBidwatcher+Software&cn=Personal+message+to+Morgan&amount=20.00&no_shipping=1&return=http%3A//www.jbidwatcher.com/donation_thanks.html">$20</a>,

<br>
PayPal charges me a percentage and minimum of 33 cents to receive funds, so in lieu of $1 and $2 donations, which I get occasionally, a few kind words in an <a href="mailto:cyberfox@jbidwatcher.com">email</a> would be wonderful.<br>
<br>
<small>If the links don't work, please go to <a href="http://www.jbidwatcher.com">http://www.jbidwatcher.com</a> and click 'Donate' on the left.)</small><br>
<br>
If the program has been useful to you, and you are in a position to help, it would mean a lot to me.<br>
